We are developing the first prototype of a new kind of social network approach. Only people holding Domocoins in their wallet will be able to login to the Network. This way mostly only 'crypto' and blockchain enthusiasts will join the Community and create an environment Cryptotwitter is dreaming of. After reaching a decent community-size within the prototype, we will do a official crowdfunding with KYC to kick off the development of a decentralized, autonomous social network, which is not run by a single entity or centralized servers. Domocoin will remain as ticket to enter the community, masternode owners and teammembers (contributors) from the early stage will have a very important role in the network. So this is your chance to join the team in early stages, earn a masternode for your effort and finally build a social network which can´t be taken down by regulations and is maintained by the people actually using it.",
